## `üöÄ My Exciting Projects üöÄ`

&nbsp;<br>

#### üõ†Ô∏è In-progress (POC): Synthetic Data Generator (Gen-X)
  
I'm currently working on an innovative SaaS Data product called Gen-X, which specializes in Synthetic Data Generation . Gen-X offers features such as Privacy-Preserving Data sharing, Data Augmentation for enhanced AI model training, Model training simulations, and support for analytics and research in enterprises.
            
#### ü©∫ Pneumonia Detection System
          
I successfully architected a robust and scalable Pneumonia Detection System designed to expedite X-ray analysis in the medical field. Leveraging the power of MXNet architecture , I implemented the MERN stack for web development. This system achieved an impressive 94.35% Validation Accuracy for 50 Epochs.
          
#### ü§ñ AI-infused SaaS Platform
          
I'm currently in the process of developing an AI-infused SaaS platform that harnesses the capabilities of OpenAI's APIs. This platform focuses on generating diverse media and code, utilizing Next.js and React for a seamless user experience, all while maintaining rigorous security and scalability.
           
#### ‚öôÔ∏è Scalable Product Recommendation System
     
I'm working on building a sophisticated Product Recommendation System using cutting-edge technologies. This system integrates Snowflake for efficient database management, DBT for ML Pipelines, MetaFlow for orchestration, AWS Sagemaker for GPU-Model Training, Nvidia Merlin framework, and RecList for testing, all presented through a user-friendly interface using Streamlit.
  
       
####  üí¨ Langchain Framework Projects
      
I've created projects using the Langchain framework, including an Invoice data extraction LLM bot and an intelligent LLM-based Automated Ticket classification and assignment app. These projects have significantly reduced manual work for data and operations teams by approximately 67%.
